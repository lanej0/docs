Getting started with TestResult is easy. Just follow these steps:

Download our [JavaScript](https://testresult.co/downloads/testresult-reporter.zip) test reporter or download our [TypeScript](https://testresult.co/downloads/testresult-reporter-ts.zip) reporter

Add the reporter to your Playwright config:

```js
// playwright.config.js

const reporter = [];
if (process.env.CI) {
  reporter.push(["./testresult-reporter.js"]);
}
module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter,
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

Set your environment variables:

```
export API_KEY= Find in Account Settings
export TEST_SUITE_UUID= Find it on your test suite page
```

Run your tests!
