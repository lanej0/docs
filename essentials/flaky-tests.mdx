These tests can pass in one run and fail in another, indicating potential issues with:

- Race conditions
- Timing dependencies
- Environmental factors
- Resource constraints
- Async operations

## How Flaky Tests are Detected

The system identifies flaky tests by analyzing test results within a single test run. A test is considered flaky if:

1. It has multiple execution attempts with different statuses
2. The final status differs from previous attempts

For example, if a test:

1. First attempt: FAILED
2. Second attempt: PASSED

This would be identified as a flaky test because the statuses are different.

## Flaky Test Dashboard

The flaky tests dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all flaky tests in your test suite. For each flaky test, you can see:

- Test name and suite
- Number of flake occurrences
- First and latest flake timestamps
- Affected projects
- Current ownership status
- Resolution status

## Threshold Indicators

Tests are marked with different indicators based on their flakiness level:

ðŸŸ¢ Green Check: Test is within acceptable flakiness thresholds or has been resolved

ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Warning: Test exceeds the configured flaky test threshold

ðŸ”´ Red Warning: Test is more than twice the acceptable threshold

## Managing Flaky Tests

You can manage flaky tests through several actions:

### Ownership

- Claim ownership of a flaky test
- Assign ownership to team members
- Release ownership when needed

### Resolution

- Mark tests as resolved when fixed
- Automatically marked as unresolved if they flake again
- Track resolution history

### Filtering

- View flaky tests within different timeframes:
  - All Time
  - Today
  - This Week
  - Last 2 Weeks
  - This Month

## Test Case Activities

The system tracks flaky test occurrences as test case activities. Each time a test exhibits flaky behavior:

- A test run activity is created with the flaky flag
- If the test was previously marked as resolved, it will automatically be marked as unresolved
- A resolution change activity is created to document the change

## Integration with CI/CD

The TestResult reporter automatically detects and reports flaky tests during your CI/CD pipeline. To enable flaky test detection:

1. Install the TestResult reporter
2. Configure your Playwright tests to use retries
3. The reporter will automatically track test results and identify flaky behavior

## Best Practices

1. Set Appropriate Thresholds

   - Configure flaky test thresholds based on your team's quality standards
   - Monitor trends to adjust thresholds as needed

2. Quick Response

   - Assign ownership promptly when new flaky tests are detected
   - Investigate and fix flaky tests before they impact team productivity

3. Documentation

   - Document patterns that led to flaky tests
   - Share fixes and preventive measures with the team

4. Regular Review
   - Schedule regular reviews of flaky tests
   - Track progress on resolution
   - Identify common patterns or areas needing architectural improvements
