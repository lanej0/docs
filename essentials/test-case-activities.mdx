Each activity represents an event or action related to the test case, such as test runs, ownership changes, or resolution updates.

## Types of Activities

The system tracks several types of activities:

- Test Runs: Records of each time the test is executed
- Ownership Changes: When someone claims or is assigned ownership
- Resolution Changes: When a test is marked as resolved or unresolved
- GitHub Integration: Creation of issues or PRs related to the test

## Activity Details

Each activity includes:

- Status (passed, failed, skipped)
- Duration
- Timestamp
- User who performed the action (for manual activities)
- Optional notes
- Error messages (for failed tests)
- Flaky test indication

## Activity Timeline

Activities are displayed in chronological order with the most recent at the top. The timeline includes:

- Visual indicators for different activity types
- Time gaps between activities
- Expandable notes sections
- Status badges

## Adding Notes

Users can add or edit notes for any activity by:

1. Clicking the edit button on an activity
2. Entering notes in the modal window
3. Saving the changes

Notes support Markdown formatting for rich text documentation.

## Automatic Activities

The system automatically creates activities for:

- Test run results from CI/CD pipelines
- Flaky test detection
- Resolution status changes when tests fail
- GitHub issue/PR creation

## Activity Retention

All activities are retained indefinitely to maintain a complete history of the test case. This helps with:

- Debugging intermittent issues
- Tracking ownership history
- Monitoring test reliability
- Documenting resolution processes
