- Create issues for failing tests
- Generate pull requests to skip flaky tests
- Track test cases across your GitHub repositories

## Setup

1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer Settings
2. Click on "Personal access tokens" and generate a new token
3. For fine-grained tokens, ensure the following permissions:

   - Repository access to your target repository
   - Contents: Read and write
   - Pull requests: Read and write
   - Issues: Read and write

4. Copy the token and paste it into the TestResult.co account settings.
5. Save the settings.

## Features

### Automatic Issue Creation

When a test fails, you can automatically create a GitHub issue with detailed test information:

- Test suite and test name
- Current status
- File location and line number
- Error message (if available)
- Test duration
- Flaky test status
- Direct link to the test case in TestResult.co

#### Example Issue:

### Skip Test Pull Requests

For flaky or problematic tests, you can automatically generate a pull request that adds a skip annotation:

1. Navigate to the test case details
2. Click "Create Skip PR"
3. A new pull request will be created with:
   - Skip annotation added to the test
   - Detailed description of why the test is being skipped
   - Link back to the test case in TestResult.co

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Invalid Repository URL

- Ensure the URL is in the correct format: `https://github.com/owner/repository`
- Both HTTPS and SSH URLs are supported

### Permission Errors

- Verify your access token has the required permissions
- Ensure the token hasn't expired
- Check that the token has access to the target repository

### Rate Limiting

- The GitHub API has rate limits
- Consider using a fine-grained token to avoid organization-wide rate limits

<Warning>
  Keep your GitHub access token secure and never share it publicly. You can
  regenerate the token at any time if you suspect it has been compromised.
</Warning>
